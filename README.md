## ðŸ†• News

- \[**August 2024**\] We propose [GraphGIM](https://github.com/cyli029/GraphGIM), a Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning Framework.

## Abstract
Learning molecular representations is crucial for accurate drug discovery. Using graphs to represent molecules is a popular solution and many researchers have used contrastive learning (CL) to improve the generalization of molecular graph representations. In this work, we revisit existing graph-based CL methods and find that these methods have limited diversity in the constructed sample pairs, resulting in insufficient performance gains. To alleviate the above challenge, we propose a novel molecular graph CL method via geometry image modeling, called GraphGIM, which enhances the diversity between sample pairs. GraphGIM is pre-trained on 2 million 2D graphs and multi-view 3D geometry images through CL. Furthermore, we find that as the convolutional layers processing the image become deeper, the information of feature maps gradually changes from global molecular-level information to local atomic-level information, which provides chemical information at different scales. Therefore, we propose two variants to further improve the performance of GraphGIM, called GraphGIM-M and GraphGIM-P, which fuse feature maps of different scales in the image using a weighted strategy and a prompt-based strategy, respectively. Extensive experiments show that GraphGIM and its two variants outperform state-of-the-art graph CL methods on eight molecular property prediction benchmarks from MoleculeNet and achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art methods.
